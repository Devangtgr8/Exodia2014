  Summary:
    Long ago there was time when people like
    Leonardo used to make mechanical like
    metal fly and wind up lion, which were very elaborate
    with complex systems of gears and springs.
    The Battle of Troy began when Greeks sail across
    the sea with their Boats. Combining the two and
    bringing the golden era of wind-up-toys.
    Exodia invites you to sail across the sea with your
    own boat.Bring yourself with intelligence and
    generosity of Leonardo Da Vinci to unfurl your
    flag on the land of Troy.<br>

    <strong>Objective</strong><br>
    The aim of the participating team is to make a
    boat which can perform the following task
    To run a straight path of about 1.5 meters, and as
    it reaches the destination it has to raise a flag.
    Boat should go on its own to perform the task,
    once its loaded and triggered, participants will
    not be allowed to touch it after that.
    The stick of the raised flag should be perpendicular to the boat.
    The flag have to be on the top of the stick.
    The boat should be able to stand in water for a long period.
    Any internal or external electric power source will
    not be allowed in the boat, its fuctionality should
    be purely based on a mechanical system.
    Teams need to have their boat complete before
    the mentioned start time of the event and they
    also need to submit an abstract explaining design
    and mechanism which they will be using in their boat.

  Rules:
    <strong>1)</strong>A team can consist of 2-3 membersts.<br>
    <strong>2)</strong> Students from different institutes can form a team.<br>
    <strong>3)</strong> Any kind of damage to the arena will attract disqualification.<br>
    <strong>4)</strong> Judges have the right to disqualify any team if they feel that team
    is not playing with fair interests.<br>
  Other Information:
    <strong>Loading & Triggering</strong><br>
    A mechanical energy storage should be employed. Only bare hands
    are allowed to give power to the toy (like keys are rotated in general
    wind-up-toys, here you can use only bare hands to rotate the key.
    No device like motor etc. are allowed to use). Any kind of (button
    or fire) trigger can be used, but the trigger should not push the boat
    with a huge force itself.<br>

    <strong>Specifications</strong><br>
    1. The toy should fit inside a box of dimensions 25cmx25cmx100cm (l x b x h).<br>
    2. The stick for the flag can be 15 to 25 cm long.<br>
    3. The flag can be made of paper, cloth or plastic.<br>

    <strong>Criteria</strong><br>
    1. The toy will be judged on the basis of design, mechanism and the task completion.<br>
    2. The mechanisms with more mechanical elements like springs, gears,
    pulleys, cams, knuckle etc and using it effectively and efficiently will
    be considered better.<br>
    3.<strong>Weightage Distribution</strong><br>
    Design-25%<br>
    Mechanism-40%<br>
    Task Completion-35%<br>
    4. There will be extra points for innovativeness.<br>
    5. Teams will be given 2 chances to perform with their toy, and best of the two will be considered.<br>
    6. Teams will need to demonstrate the functionalities in front of judges.<br>

    <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
    The written abstract should be prepared on the following line<br>
    1. Materials used for different parts.<br>
    2. Layout of the mechanism, for running the boat and to raise the flag.<br>
    3. Points considered for making the boat design.<br>

    Team name, Name of all the team members, college, degree pursuing, year should be mentioned on the front page of the abstract. Last date for abstract submission is February 10, 2013. Send your abstracts to bhavesh_silawat@students.iitmandi.ac.in
